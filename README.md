# microCMS
## A small and simple CMS made with no any framework.
Frontend is based on HTML, JavaScript (jQuery) and CSS. Backend is based on PHP and MySQL database. Communication between frontend and backend runs through API.
Installer is included.
To enable uploading images you have to set attribute 777 for folder '/upload'.
Front web page is based on free responsive template. Admin Panel also! :)
## Installation steps:
- upload project files to hosting to 'public_html' folder
- create empty MySQL database (and remember database name, user and password)
- write down these data into config file '/config/config.php'
- open URL of your domain address in web browser
- click button 'Install Backend of Application' and register yourself as ADMIN.
